Hello!

This is a bot where you input your discord token, and a specified server/channel ID in order to reply to messages using Groq's api!

How to do it
1. Download the python file
2. Get a groq api key by going to: https://console.groq.com/keys
3. Then put in your user id so that the bot does not reply to your own messages
4. Finally put in the specified server ID and chat channel

Make sure to change the delay depending on the slow mode!
